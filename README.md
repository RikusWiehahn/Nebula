# ✨ Nebula ✨
 Nebula is an 100% on-chain database and data management system with an easy-to-use UI. 
 
The goal is to enable Web3 devs to build infinitely scalable applications without having to worry about managing canister balances, canister memory limits and data loss from data-structure changes.
 
🌍 Hosted on Internet computer
🚀 Built in Rust and Typescript

## It will let you:
- Create data models that are stored in their own set of canisters that grow to as many as needed.
- Manage one balance only. Sub canisters will automatically be added, removed, and topped up with cycles.
- Update these data models with the changes propagated to all records stored without any accidental loss of data.
- Get auto-generated code snippets for calling the Create/Read/Update/Delete methods on any of the data models.
- Set a list of trusted canisters authorized to call the "CRUD" methods above.
- Create secure API keys that enable Web2 backends to call the "CRUD" methods too.

## 🚧 Project status 🚧
Progress is still at a very early prototype stage, I would not recommend using it just yet!
